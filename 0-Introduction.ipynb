    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this course I'll try to teach the basic tools that you need for data analysis in Python. How things generally work is that I will provide a short explanation of some concepts and leave the details to the readings. I may also complement them with some everyday useful tricks. Then, I'll give you some exercises to test your skills. You should go through everything properly - there are no due dates, there is no grading, so take your time and do things right. You can only cheat yourself here :)\n",

    "We'll start off in this lecture by showing you how to use Jupyter Lab (the environment in which you will be working in all the time) and Git, a very useful tool for keeping track of changes in your code. There will be no programming in this lecture."

    "## Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "You're using it right now :) It's an evolution of Jupyter Notebooks, a really great leap which brings it closer to being an full fledged IDE. It's relatively new, so you will probably hear people mentioning Jupyter notebooks more - but this is the *future* :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "As you can see, the code is organized in cells (even this text is a cell - double click on it to see it!). Cells are of two types - Markdown (text) or code. \n",
    "You can execute the cells by selecting them and them pressing either <kybd>Shift</kybd>+<kybd>Enter</kybd> or <kybd>Crtl</kybd>+<kybd>Enter</kybd>. The first one executes the cell and moves you to the cell bellow, while the second one just executes the cell (and doesn't move you anywhere). If you have a lot of cells to execute you may find yourself pressing <kybd>Shift</kybd>+<kybd>Enter</kybd> furiously :)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two cells bellow all this text - first one is text, second one is code. Execute them both, try out the two different keyboard commands!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard shortcuts \n",
    "Now that we know how to execute cells, let's talk about creating and deleting them. You probably see a + sign in the menu bar above - yup, that creates a new cell (you can try it). But this is not the best way to do it. The best way to do it is with keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing everything down, read the link bellow:\n",
    "- [Link bellow](http://maxmelnick.com/2016/04/19/python-beginner-tips-and-tricks.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try out the shortcuts explained there! If you are having some problems:\n",
    "- To enter edit mode, just double click on the cell (this you probably got)\n",
    "- To enter command mode, click in the white space just to the right of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very useful command mode shortcut not mentioned:\n",
    "- <kbd>Z</kbd> - it's like <kybd>CTRL</kybd>+<kybd>Z</kybd>, but for cell operations (so if you deleted cell, <kybd>Z</kybd> in command mode will bring it back, etc.)\n",
    "- <kybd>CTRL</kybd><kybd>Shift</kybd><kybd>-</kybd> splits the cell at the selcted place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all we need right now. You can probably see that Jupyter lab has tabs (very useful), and you can also make these tabs half-window sized, like you do in Windows. Open a new tab and try it out :) If you haven't figured it out yet, you can hide the siedbar as well. Also, Jupyter Lab includes editors for a variety of file. For example, open `README.md` file (you should see it in the sidebar). When you are in it, right click and select \"Show Markdown preview\". Amazing, isn't it! (Don't be afraid of making changes to that file). To see cool stuff that Jupyter lab can do, you can have a look at this post, or the documentation:\n",

    "Yay, almost done! Now I'll show you git - the basics, and also how the workflow for this course will be like (i.e., how you submit exercises). You don't have to worry about installing anything - git is automatically installed on your machines. Short introduction on what git is, and why it is useful (and why not just use Dropbox):\n",
    "\n",
    "First, git is a version control software. It's great for:\n",
    "- Keeping track of exactly when you implemented feature X in your code\n",
    "- Collaborating on the same codebase (i.e., all your code files) with your teammmates, each working on your own feature, merging your work when you finish\n",
    "- Collaborating on open source projects\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not good for:\n",
    "- Just saving files. First of all, it's super slow, so forget uploading large files. Really, it's just meant for code - simple, (relatively) small text files. Saving files is what dropbox is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "It beats dropbox for code, because, as you will learn, it enables multiple people to work on the same document at the same time, merging their edits gracefully when you finish. Dropbox, on the other hand, would try to enforce the same version on everybody - if two people were editing a document at the same time, it would give some nasty duplicated \"conflict\" files, which you would have to manually merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last thing before I send you off to the readings: there are two ways to use git. Using the terminal, or using a GUI app. GUI apps are great, but it's useful to know how to use the terminal as well - for that reason, I think you should execute all git commands via terminal for this course (I have no way of controlling for this, of course, but I think it is for your own good). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, some things are just so much better using GUI that it makes no sense doing them in terminal. The two things I have in mind are:\n",
    "- Seeing the history of commits. GUI can show you nice branches and everything, it's not limited to ASCII characters, as the terminal is\n",
    "- Merging changes - you can much clearly see the changes that occured in the GUI, with the code highlighting and all, and also more easily select which ones to keep (and which not to)\n",
